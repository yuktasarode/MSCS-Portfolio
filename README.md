## Projects Overview

### 1. CSE 579 - Knowledge Representation: Automated Warehouse Scenario

#### Technology and Implementation

- **Answer Set Programming (ASP):** Learned and applied ASP to model and solve complex, constrained problems using Clingo.
- **ASPRILO Visualization:** Utilized ASPRILO to visualize warehouse layouts and robot movements, aiding in debugging and refinement.
- **Optimization:** Implemented optimizations to minimize robot actions and time taken to fulfill orders.
- **System Design:** Modeled the warehouse as a grid and defined constraints such as preventing collisions, ensuring safe shelf handling, and optimizing delivery routes.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Constraint Definition:** Balancing multiple constraints while ensuring feasible solutions.
- **Edge Cases:** Identifying and addressing edge cases that could disrupt operations.
- **Dynamic Systems:** Adapting to the dynamic nature of order requests and environmental conditions.

#### Lessons Learned

- The power of ASP in handling combinatorial optimization problems.
- Designing effective action and state representations.
- Iterative problem-solving and debugging through visualization tools.

### 2. CSE 578 - Data Visualization: 2020 VAST Challenge MC-1

#### Technology and Implementation

- **D3.js for Interactive Visualizations:** Created interconnected visualizations, including network diagrams, bar charts, and heatmaps.
- **Innovative Visualizations:** 
  1. Combined a **pie chart as a filter** to sift through data interactively.
  2. Enhanced network graphs with **donut charts on each node**, providing deeper clarity into individual nodes.
- **Five Design Sheets Methodology:** Applied this methodology for structured and effective design processes.
- **Data Cleaning:** Condensed and refined dataset categories to improve visualization clarity.
- **Dashboard Development:** Developed a web-based dashboard using D3.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Data Noise:** Identified and excluded unreliable spatial data deemed as random noise.
- **Team Collaboration:** Managed diverse contributions and maintained consistency in visualization components.
- **Design Optimization:** Balancing aesthetics and functionality in the visualizations.

#### Lessons Learned

- The importance of data cleaning and preprocessing for effective visual analysis.
- Collaborative teamwork and version control using Git.
- Leveraging interactive visualizations to uncover patterns in complex datasets.
